Hello!  My name is Japheth Carlson and I'm passionate about sharing interesting and original results in mathematics, data science and machine learning!  I will update this page soon, but in the meantime, the sidebar links are active.  If you're interested in learning more about me and my work, please check everything out.

Projects
======

Ranging from coursework to research and passion projects, below are highlights from several of my favorite projects I've worked on.  Code bases may be found at my GitHub site (hyperlinked at the left side bar).

Project Summaries
------

**Modeling Air-Borne Pollution** [PDF](/files/SLC_Project.pdf)

_Japheth Carlson, Nathan Longhurst, Rowan Williams_

Collaborative project using PDEs to model airborne arsenic concentration in the Salt Lake Valley due to declining water levels.


**Predicting National Life Expectancy** [PDF](/files/Life_Expectancy_Project.pdf)

_Japheth Carlson, Nathan Longhurst_

Applying various machine learning methods to predict national life expectancy based on WHO data.


**Large-Scale Graph Layering** (COMING SOON)

_Japheth Carlson, Wyatt Pochman_

One component of a forthcoming research paper with additional collaborators aimed at understanding genealogical networks as mathematical objects.



Papers
======
Below is a selection of papers I have worked on that are either submitted for publication or somewhere in the process toward publication.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have!

Paper Summaries
------
**Counting Zeros of Complex-Valued Harmonic Functions via Rouché's Theorem** [Pre-Print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06721)

_Japheth Carlson_

Building on previous work, I extend the harmonic analogue of Rouche's theorem to count the zeros of complex-valued harmonic polynomials with critical curves of varying geometries.  Submitted for publication to _Bulletin of the Malaysian Mathematical Sciences Society_.


**Hallmarks of Genealogical Networks** _(COMING SOON)_

_Japheth Carlson, Teayoun Kim, Matthew Lawyer, Wyatt Pochman, Emeline Thygerson, Benjamin Webb_

Analyzing more than 100 genealogical networks, we discuss many of the fundamental mathematical and statistical properties of genealogical networks.  Paper in progress.


**Honors Thesis**

_Japheth Carlson_

Forthcoming later in 2026.
